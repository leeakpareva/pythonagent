Let me explain the capabilities of this AI agent:

1. **Data Analysis Capabilities**:
   - Can read and analyze Excel data
   - Provides statistical summaries of the data
   - Can see column names and the first few rows of your dataset
   - Can answer questions about trends, patterns, and insights in your business data

2. **Two Types of Responses**:
   - `get_response()`: Simple Q&A without data context
   - `get_response_with_data()`: Answers questions using the Excel data as context

3. **Business Intelligence Features**:
   - Acts as a business data expert
   - Can interpret numerical data and statistics
   - Can provide insights based on the data summary and raw data

4. **Data Context Understanding**:
   - Uses both statistical summaries (`df.describe()`)
   - Sees actual data samples (`df.head()`)
   - Has access to column names and structure

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Gracefully handles errors in data loading
   - Provides clear error messages if something goes wrong
   - Continues running even if individual queries fail

To use the agent effectively, you can:

1. Ask business-related questions about your Excel data
2. Request statistical analysis
3. Ask for trends or patterns
4. Get insights about specific columns or metrics

Example questions you could ask:
- "What are the key trends in our data?"
- "Can you summarize the main statistics?"
- "What insights can you provide about [specific column]?"
- "What are the highest and lowest values in our dataset?"
- "Are there any notable patterns in the data?"

To see the exact capabilities with your specific dataset, it would help to know what columns and types of data are in your Excel file. The agent can work with any structured data in Excel format.


### Example Questions
- "What are the key trends in our data?"
- "Can you summarize the main statistics?"
- "What insights can you provide about [specific column]?"
- "What are the highest and lowest values in our dataset?"
- "Are there any notable patterns in the data?"

## File Structure
- `ceo_ai_agents.py`: Main program file
- `ai_agent.py`: AI agent class implementation
- Your Excel data file

## Error Handling
- Handles data loading errors
- Provides clear error messages
- Continues running after non-fatal errors

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
- Pandas
- OpenPyXL (for Excel file handling)

## Note
Make sure your Excel file is properly formatted with headers and consistent data types for best results.
